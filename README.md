# 🤖 AI Operations Copilot — Revenue Anomaly Investigation Agent

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **production-grade AI Operations Copilot** that assists business analysts in investigating revenue anomalies.

It combines:

* LLM reasoning
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Tool-based analytics
* Conversation memory
* Feedback-driven adaptation
* Dual orchestration (LangChain + LangGraph)

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Business teams struggle to quickly diagnose:

* Revenue drops
* Regional performance issues
* Refund anomalies

Manual workflows are slow, inconsistent, and lack explainability.

---

## ✅ Solution

An AI Copilot that:

* Provides **data-driven insights**
* Uses **tools for accurate computation**
* Maintains **context-aware conversations**
* Adapts using **user feedback**
* Enforces **safety-first behavior**

---

## 👤 User Persona

**Primary User:** Business / Operations Analyst

### Workflow:

* Ask analytical questions
* Investigate anomalies
* Validate insights
* Generate reports

---

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* FAISS-based vector search
* Dynamic CSV ingestion
* Context-aware responses

---

### 🛠️ Tool-Based Reasoning

* Revenue trend analysis
* Region comparison
* Anomaly detection

---

### 🧠 Memory & Context

* Multi-turn conversation support
* Context retention

---

### 🔁 Feedback Adaptation

* 👍 / 👎 feedback collection
* Improves future responses

---

### 🛡️ Safety Enforcement

* Refuses unsafe requests
* Avoids hallucination
* Explains uncertainty

---

## 🔐 Authentication & API Key Handling

The system supports **two access modes**:

### 1️⃣ Login Mode (Demo Mode)

* User logs in with:

  ```
  Username: admin
  Password: admin123
  ```
* System uses **internal OpenAI API key**

---

### 2️⃣ API Key Mode (User Mode)

* User provides their own OpenAI API key
* System uses user-provided key for inference

---

### 🔒 Security Notes

* API keys are **never logged**
* External keys are stored **only in session**
* No sensitive data is persisted

---

## 🔁 Agent Orchestration

The system supports **two frameworks**:

---

### 🔗 LangChain (Baseline)

```text
Query → Memory → Retrieval → Tool → Response
```

---

### 🔄 LangGraph (Production)
